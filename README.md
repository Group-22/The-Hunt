# The-Hunt
Our game is called "The Hunt", and it involves a fox and hunter. The goal of the game is for the fox to collect all of the berries that are in the world. The hunters chase the fox around the world, while the fox tries to collect all the berries. The hunters will begin in the middle of the world, while the fox will start at the bottom left corner. There will be three different "berries" the fox can collect; plums, apples, and cherries. Plums will be spaced evenly around the world and will be the main "berry" the fox must collect. After all plums are collected, the game ends. Some of the berries are larger than the others, and give the fox the ability to fight back and "eat" the hunter. These "berries" will be represented as apples and appear at each corner of the world. There will be two cherries that appear in the middle of the world and make the fox faster. These will be represented as cherries. Once the hunter has been "eaten", he will flash and no longer be able to move for 10 seconds. After 10 seconds are up, he will be able to move and chase the fox again.
